This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r Uploading Data}
Up_regulated <- read.csv("Sailfish_Limma_up.csv")
Down_regulated <- read.csv("Sailfish_Limma_down.csv")

library(dplyr)

Up_down_formatted <- read.csv("Sailfish_Limma_formatted_updown.csv")
Up_down_formatted <- select(Up_down_formatted, Align, DE, Direction, ID) #removing unecessary columns
write.csv(Up_down_formatted, file = "Sailfish_Limma_updownregulation_table.tsv", quote = FALSE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
